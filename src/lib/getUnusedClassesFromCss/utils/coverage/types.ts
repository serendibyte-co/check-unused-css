/**
 * Classification of a single `styles[...]` / `styles.foo` access site, used to
 * decide which CSS-module class names it could possibly reference at runtime.
 *
 * - `literals`: the exact, statically-known set of class names
 *   (`styles.foo`, `styles['foo']`, `styles[cond ? 'a' : 'b']`).
 * - `pattern`: a template with at least one constant segment
 *   (`` styles[`btn-${x}`] ``); `regex` matches a class name iff the template
 *   could produce it (every `${...}` is a `.*` wildcard).
 * - `coversAll`: the expression could resolve to any class name (bare variable,
 *   call, concatenation, template without constants, ternary with a non-literal
 *   branch). Conservative: suppresses unused-checking for the whole module.
