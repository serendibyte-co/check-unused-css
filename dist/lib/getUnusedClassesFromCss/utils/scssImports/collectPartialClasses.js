/**
 * Collects every class name reachable from a CSS module through `@use`,
 * `@forward` and the legacy `@import`, following the chain transitively. These
 * classes are emitted into the module's compiled CSS, so for the module they
 * are real classes — used here to stop reporting them as "non-existent" and to
 * avoid flagging them as unused (issue #90).
 *
 * The walk is breadth-first over resolved absolute paths and guards against
 * cycles (legal with `@import`) and diamonds via a visited set. The module's
 * own file is seeded as visited so its classes are not double-counted here —
 * they are already extracted by the caller.
 *
 * A resolved partial may itself be a `.css` file: Sass loads `code.css` for a
 * bare `@use 'code'` / `@import 'code'` and inlines its rules, so collecting
 * those classes is correct. (A trailing-`.css` spec like `@import 'code.css'`
 * is a plain, non-inlined CSS import and is already filtered out upstream.)
