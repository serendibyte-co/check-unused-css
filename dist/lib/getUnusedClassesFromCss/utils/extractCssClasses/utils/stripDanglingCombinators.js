/**
 * Removing the parent `&` from a nested SCSS/CSS-Modules selector (see
 * clearGlobalSelectors) can leave a combinator (`>`, `+`, `~`) with a missing
 * operand — the `&` it referred to is gone:
 *
 *   `.skipLink + &`  -> `.skipLink +`    (trailing: no right operand)
 *   `& + .after`     -> `+ .after`       (leading: no left operand)
 *   `.a + & + .b`    -> `.a + + .b`       (two combinators, one shared operand)
 *   `.a + &, .b ~ &` -> `.a +, .b ~`     (trailing in each list member)
 *
 * `css-selector-parser` rejects any of these ("Expected rule but '+' found"),
 * which would silently drop every class in the rule. A combinator that lost its
 * `&` operand carries no class of its own, so for class extraction it is pure
 * noise. This normalizes each top-level member of the selector list:
 *
 * - a combinator at the start or end of a member is dropped;
 * - a run that collapses to two or more combinators between two compounds
 *   (e.g. `+ +`) becomes a single descendant combinator (one space);
 * - a lone combinator that still separates two compounds (`.wrapper > .item`)
 *   is preserved verbatim.
 *
 * Commas, combinators, and whitespace inside parens, brackets, or quotes — e.g.
 * `[style*="a>b"]` or `:is(.a + .b)` — are left byte-for-byte untouched; only
 * top-level tokens are considered.
