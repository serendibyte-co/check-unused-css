 * Prints `question` to `output` (default: stdout), reads one line from `input`

 * (`y` / `Y` / `yes` / `YES`). Anything else (including empty input or EOF)
 * resolves to `false`.
 *
 * The readline interface is closed before the promise resolves so the process
 * can exit cleanly afterwards.
 *
 * The `input` / `output` parameters exist purely for test injection — real
 * callers should pass nothing.
